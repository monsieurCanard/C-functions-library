## Description

This is my own C functions library that may help you as it helped me along my C cursus.

## Contents

* Conversion (atoi, itoa)
* Display (putstr, putnbr ...)
* Dynamic and Static stacking using functions (add, pop, peek ...)
* Identifier (isprint, isalnum ...)
* Linked list using functions (add back, add front ..)
* Memory (memset, calloc, bzero ...)
* String (strjoin, strdup, substr ...)
* Vector2 and 3 math functions (normalize, magnitude ...)

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/monsieurCanard/C-functions-library.git
